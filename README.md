genetic_algorithms_lib
======================

This project is intented to be a library for Genetic Algorithms (GA). In order to make GA the library is implemented using multi-threading and OpenMP.

The library itself will be developed to be concurrent and the fitness function will be able to be placed in (as concurrent or sequencial as desired) to allow for various problems to be solved using GA.
